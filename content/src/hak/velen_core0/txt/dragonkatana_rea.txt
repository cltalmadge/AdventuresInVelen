Dragon katana by Claude <c.lanaud@wanadoo.fr>

This is a katana created for my game character. I keep the bases of the katana n°11 of the CEP, modify the blade, and created handle by myself from the Vampire Bloodlines katana handle.

Model: 
bottom: 42 vertices, 54 faces
middle: 136 v, 232 f (detailed head and guard, few visible yet, unless when camera is focused on.)
top: 28 v, 42 f

Texture:
swka5.tga: 512*512*4 tga, model texture (1Mb heavy, for details)
iwswgs_#.tga: 64*128*4 tga, item icons

Credits:
-CEP katana n°11 for getting the dimensions of the model, the base of the blade, and the icons
-Troïka Games for the original textures
-Neverblender import script

Programms:
modeler: Blender3D (www.blender.org)
texture: Paint Shop Pro 5
exporter: MDLexporterv0.14 (selfmade python script)

Troubles:
-middle and bottom (handle parts) are made to be used together.

Version:
1.00
-Possible to reduce details on middle parts and making the handle parts compatible with others NWN models
-Possible texture resizing

Model and textures free of use or modifiy. Include credits when using it in your mods or hakpak.
