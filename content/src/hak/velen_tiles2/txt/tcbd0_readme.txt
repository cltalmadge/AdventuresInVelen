Summary/Critique/Tips/Notes:
 
This set is amazing. Think of a desert of black volcanic sand. Great architecture in the building terrains as well. Very easy set to build with as long as you remember it is BLACK sand, dirt etc. May need to turn off area lighting while in toolset to be able to fully see what you are working with.
It's a desert environment, but that doesn't mean it has to be a traditional desert. Given it's darkened color, this could be just about any wasteland you might need. The addition of housing terrain plus the stargate rend this one useful for alternate universes and parallel dimensional worlds.
