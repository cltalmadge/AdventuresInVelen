Summary/Critique/Tips/Notes: I like this set. It's no secret I like the dark settings for environments, but this one is quite easy to build with and has a tremendous amount of possible locales. It's a desert environment, but that doesn't mean it has to be a traditional desert. Given it's darkened color, this could be just about any wasteland you might need. The addition of housing terrain plus the stargate rend this one useful for alternate universes and parallel dimensional worlds.
