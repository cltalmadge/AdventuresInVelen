Summary/Critique/Tips/Notes:

This is a very well done reskin of the standard Bioware set. You may even be able to find the Easter egg buried in there somewhere, but you will have to look closely!
This set has so many varied interior types that it could be used to simulate anything from a smithy, inn or bordello, it also contains the more basic, pre-designed interiors for houses inns, shops etc. Very easy to use with a familiar layout in the toolset.
